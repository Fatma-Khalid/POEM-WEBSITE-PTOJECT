         <p>Hello and welcome to my poetic corner of the digital universe! I'm Fatma Khalid Salum, a budding poet who embarked on this heartfelt journey in 2019, where the magic of words began to intertwine with the threads of my thoughts and emotions. Inspired by the timeless wordsmiths who have paved the way for poetic expression,<br><br> I find solace and motivation in the works of Robert Frost, Maya Angelou, and Langston Hughes.

In the dance of words, I've discovered a passion for crafting verses that echo the simplicity of life's profound moments. My poetic repertoire draws inspiration from the rich tapestry of human connections, bidding farewell in "Goodbye," celebrating camaraderie in poems about friendship, and navigating the intricate landscape of emotions in pieces that touch the very core of the heart.<br><br>

Through the lens of my words, I invite you to embark on a journey of reflection and introspection. Each poem is a heartfelt whisper, a tender embrace of shared experiences that resonate in the universal language of emotions. Join me as we navigate the subtle nuances of human connections, exploring themes of friendship, farewells, and matters of the heart.<br>
