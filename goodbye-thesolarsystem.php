        Tears are shedding, with sadness and pain<br> 
        Hearts are pounding, the sorrow complain<br>
        A gem worth lasting, has drifted in rain<br> 
        You forever shall be, in our hearts sustained<br><br><br>
        If there was a word, beyond I will miss you<br>
        I would say it out loud, so far to get you<br>
         A gift that we had, will always be you<br>
         Still imagining the life, for being without you.<br><br><br>
         Wishing you luck, will always be our do <br>
         You left o us a mark, that we can't undo  <br>
          Wish you'll come back, but there is nothing we can do<br>
          All the happiest moments, that we shared with you<br><br><br>
          Still lots to say, words and not essay<br>
        Promissing to this day, we'll follow your way<br>
         Despite the miles away, you are never far away<br>
        You are the sunshine, to light up our day<br><br><br>
        Good bye our teacher, our mother and friend <br>
        Our pain is bitter, and we can not pretend<br>
        With your love we glitter, and high we stand <br>
        In your heart you can hold us, with both your hands<br><br>

            Be like the sun, so bright and fun <br>
            Don't be like mercury, with flames and misery <br>
Be like venus, so close and precious <br>
Don't be like earth, for guiding a wrong path <br>
Be like mars, supportive and not worse <br>
 Dont be like jupiter, so angry as a fighter  <br>
 Be like saturn, beautiful like a pattern <br>
Don't be like uranus, so cold and dangerous  <br>
Be like neptune, for spreading good fortune  <br>
Don't be like pluto, so lost as far it go <br>
Be a star, cause that's who you are.
